BZR SCM LWRP
============

This cookbook provides a LWRP for easily creating and managing bzr branches.

**This cookbook has been created by Akretion to work with OpenERP. Hence
some choices are made to support our OpenERP workflow rather than just
work with bzr with Chef in general although there is no dependency
on OpenERP.**

Specially, we provides hacks to support stacked branches or bootstraping
the src tree with a tarball. This is because OpenERP bzr code isn't
fast to checkout from Launchpad...

This Cookbook is heavly inspired by the git resource and provider by GetChef
https://github.com/opscode/chef/blob/master/lib/chef/resource/git.rb
https://github.com/opscode/chef/blob/master/lib/chef/provider/git.rb

Akretion open sourced this recipe in the hope in can be useful to somebody.
If you wish to contribute, we may consider making it a generic bzr provider.

Until this eventually becomes a generic bzr provider, we prefer call the
resource "ak_bzr_branch" rather than say just "bzr" so it won't conflict
with another possibly more generic bzr provider.


Usage
-----

example of ak_bzr_branch resource:

```ruby
ak_bzr_branch "#{node[:openerp][:home]}/prod/pt-br-localiz" do
  repo "lp:openerp.pt-br-localiz#HEAD"
  action :sync 
  user some_user
  group some_groups
  notifies :run, resources(:execute => "some_service")
end
```
